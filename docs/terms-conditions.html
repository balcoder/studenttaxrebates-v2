        <li>Services related to Irish Tax law and Changes to Required Information</li>
        </ol>
        <p>7.1 Unfortunately we are unable to provide the Services where they relate to laws other than Ireland. Our Services are limited to those specific laws of Ireland which are directly related to the Services we provide.</p>
        <p>7.2 You may place an order for the Services from an address outside Ireland, but this order must relate to our Services as defined.</p>
        <p>7.3<strong>&nbsp;You the Customer must advise us in writing of any change of your circumstances or in the Required Information. Where the Customer comprises two natural persons, such obligation applies to each of you.</strong></p>
        <ol start="8">
        <li>Charges, and Additional Charges</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>8.1&nbsp;</strong>In consideration of us providing the Services you must pay our charges (<strong>Charges</strong>) in accordance with this clause 8. Our Charges are based on the tax refund secured for each individual Customer from the Tax Authority (currently 15% of any tax refund secured), with a minimum charge of &euro;20.</p>
        <p><strong>8.2</strong>&nbsp;The Charges are the fees quoted on our Site at the time you submit your order. The Additional Charges are those applicable to Additional Services we have agreed to provide, shall be as quoted on the Site at the time you submit your order or where not so published, as agreed by us with you in writing.</p>
        <p><strong>8.3&nbsp;</strong>Where we undertake Additional Services for you, you must pay us in advance, the Additional Charges we have notified to you or published on our Site at the relevant time, before we undertake the Additional Services.</p>
        <p><strong>8.4&nbsp;</strong>If you wish to change the scope of the Services after we accept your order, and we agree to such change, we will modify the Charges accordingly.</p>
        <p><strong>8.5&nbsp;</strong>We take all reasonable care to ensure that the prices stated for the Services are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered into the system. However, please see clause 8.8 for what happens if we discover an error in the price of the Services we have agreed to provide.</p>
        <p><strong>8.6&nbsp;</strong>We reserve the right to increase the Charges for the Services from time to time. Provided that no increased Charges shall apply to any Order for Services already accepted by us. We reserve the right to increase the Additional Charges for Additional Services from time to time. Provided that no increased Additional Charges shall apply to any Order for Additional Services accepted by us.</p>
        <p><strong>8.7&nbsp;</strong>Our Charges and Additional Charges are exclusive of VAT. Where VAT is payable in respect of some or all of the Services and or Additional Services, you must pay us such additional amounts in respect of VAT, at the applicable rate, at the same time as you pay the Charges and or Additional Charges.</p>
        <p><strong>8.8&nbsp;</strong>It is always possible that, despite our reasonable efforts, some of the Services on our Site may be incorrectly priced. Where the correct price for the Services is less than the price stated on our Site, we will charge the lower amount.</p>
        <ol start="9">
        <li>Tax Refunds and Costs</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>9.1&nbsp;</strong>If a tax refund is sent directly to you, by the Tax Authorities as a result of the Services performed by us, you will be liable to pay against our invoice our Charges for such Services, within 30 days of the date of our invoice communicated to you in accordance with clause 18. In these circumstances you the Customer can pay for the Services agreed to be provided by us by bank transfer.</p>
        <p><strong>9.2&nbsp;</strong>Upon receipt by us of the tax refund from the Taxing Authorities, we will deduct our Charges and pay the balance to you by cheque or where we have agreed to do so in writing by interbank transfer. In either case, you the Customer will be responsible for any bank charges levied by the Bank you use to obtain the cash equivalent of the cheque we send you. Where any bank charges are applied by the Bank to us, either arising from our paying you by cheque or interbank transfer, you the Customer undertake to indemnify and pay us any such applicable charges that are applied to us on your refund cheque, as communicated to you in accordance with clause 18.</p>
        <p><strong>9.3&nbsp;</strong>Where the Customer comprises two natural persons arising from the fact that they are jointly assessed for tax by the Taxing Authority, then the Customer comprises each of them and each of them shall be jointly and severally liable for the obligations of the Customer under these Terms. Additionally, where the Customer is a natural person, the Customer includes his or personal representative or successor at law. Where the Customer comprises two natural persons who are jointly assessed by the Taxing Authority, each of you agree, that we may exercise our rights under these Terms in respect of each of you and you agree that we may pay any refund to you jointly.</p>
        <p><strong>9.4&nbsp;</strong>If you fail to make a payment under these Terms by the due date, then, without limiting our remedies under clause 15 (Termination), you will have to pay interest on the overdue sum from the due date until payment of the overdue sum, whether before or after judgment. Interest under this clause 4 will accrue each day at 4% a year above the Allied Irish Banks plc base rate from time to time, but at 4% a year for any period when that base rate is below 0%.</p>
        <p><strong>9.5&nbsp;</strong>You must pay all amounts due under these Terms in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding (other than any deduction or withholding of tax as required by law).</p>
        <ol start="10">
        <li>Complaints</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>10.1&nbsp;</strong>If the Customer has a complaint in relation to us or anything on this Site, the user can email to info@studenttaxrebates.ie as soon as possible but within seven days of the date of the issue which gives rise to the complaint. In doing so, we would ask the user to provide us in writing with sufficient background information for us to verify the complaint and evaluate the complaint.</p>
        <p><strong>10.2&nbsp;</strong>We will endeavour to respond to any complaint as quickly as possible. Our ability to respond will be dependent on the nature and complexity of the user&rsquo;s complaint, the extent to which we can contact the user to get information on the complaint and the extent to which User needs to obtain information from a third party relevant to the complaint to frame a response. Subject to these Terms we will make our best effort to find a satisfactory solution to the user&rsquo;s complaint. However, this shall not apply where the complaint is vexatious or where it is clearly unsubstantiated or malicious.</p>
