        <li><strong> Authorisation to act as agent</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>I, the undersigned, declare to the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland, that I authorise Student Tax Rebates to act as my agent with regard to all aspects&nbsp;<br />of my income tax.</p>
        <p>I understand that this agreement will remain in place until such time as either party, the client or the agent, has notified the Revenue Commissioners of Ireland in writing of their wish to cancel this agreement.</p>
        <ol start="2">
        <li><strong> Authorisation for Agent to receive refunds on behalf of client&nbsp;</strong><br /><br />I authorise the transfer of any refund or repayment of PAYE/Income Levy/Universal Social Charge due to me by the Revenue Commissioners by electronic funds transfer to the following bank account which is held by Student Tax Rebates:</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Bank:</strong>XXX<br /><strong>BIC Code:</strong>XXXXXX<br /><strong>IBAN Number:</strong>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
        <p><strong>Name of Account Holder:</strong>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>
        <p>I understand that any refund made by the Revenue Commissioners to my agent, Student Tax Rebates, on my behalf is refunded in a similar manner as if same were being refunded directly to me and that once the refund is transferred into the bank account nominated by me I have no further call upon the Revenue Commissioners in respect of same. I understand that Student Tax Rebates is acting as my agent and is solely responsible to me in respect of any refund received by them on my behalf. I further understand that my agent Student Tax Rebates is an independent entity and that the Revenue Commissioners make no endorsement of my agent or any such agency and cannot accept any responsibility whatsoever for problems encountered by me in dealing with them. I understand and agree that Student Tax Rebates will input its own bank account details on the Revenue record for the duration of this mandate and will remove these details on the cessation of the mandate. I confirm that I am aware of, and agree to, the payment of the fees charged by Student Tax Rebates in respect of the services carried out on my behalf and that this fee will be deducted from any amount refunded by Revenue and that the balance of this amount will be paid to me.</p>
        <ol start="3">
        <li><strong> Terms and Conditions of Authorisation</strong><br /><br />I understand that Tax law provides for both civil penalties and criminal sanctions for the failure to make a return, the making of a false return, facilitating the making of a false return, or claiming tax credits, allowances or reliefs which are not due. I confirm that I will provide the necessary documentation to Student Tax Rebates to support any refund, credit claims or claims for allowances and reliefs made to Revenue on my behalf of Student Tax Rebates. I confirm that I will provide details of all my sources of income to Student Tax Rebates. I understand that Student Tax Rebates is required to retain a copy of all documentation relating to any refund or credit or allowance or relief claimed by the agent on my behalf and that the agent will be required to produce same to Revenue upon request.</li>
